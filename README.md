# Sonet

Sonet it is a mini social network with basic functionality.

## Installation
If you want to work with the source code.

Use the ```git clone``` command to clone the source files. There is one problem... You will not be able to get files from the server directory. This directory is tied to Heroku.

Then install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

You don't have to use npm, but whatever tool you like.
